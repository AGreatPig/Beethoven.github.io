        <h3 class="sectionBackgroundInfo" id="section-BGI">Background Information</h3>
        <p class="backgroundInfo">Known as one of the greatest classical composers, Ludwig Van Beethoven was a German pianist who's goal was to turn music into &quot;sound poems&quot;. 
            Beethoven struggled against deafness, which was exactly the time when he was composing his most important works. Luckliy, he memorized all of the keys on the piano and was 
            able to finish these projects.<br> <br>Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770, in the city of Bonn in the Electorate of Cologne, which belonged to the Roman Empire. Beethoven had 
            two younger brothers: Casper, being 4 years younger then Ludwig &lpar;1774&rpar;, and Johann, being 6 years younger &lpar;1776&rpar;. Beethoven's father, who's name was also
            Johann van Beethoven, was a court singer and an alcoholic who beat his son into practicing music. But Beethoven's mother, is every good mother, a kind, caring and gentil 
            woman. Beethoven didn't start liking music because of his fathers actions, but morely because his grandfather, Kapellmeister Ludwig van Beethoven, was Bonn's greastest musician at
            the time. Beethoven passed away on March 26, 1827 at the age of 56 because he suffered from lead poisoning.<br> <br>The musical prodigy attended a Latin grade school named Tirocinium. His grades were looking average, except in mathamatics. Having left school at age 11, 
            Beethoven never learned how to multiply or divide. He was at best an average student.<br> <br>The instruments that Beethoven has played are, piano, organ, harpsichord, violin and viola. Piano was his main instrument, and he played it continuously until his death. The 
            organ was also another instrument he enjoyed. This instrument gave him experience playing for the public, since his music teacher would make Beethoven substitute for him 
            whenever the teacher was gone. Historains believe that young Beethoven played piano on a harpsichord, which is somewhat like a piano. He also played the violin and viola,
            he was not as good with those instruments as much as the piano but at least was above average. In fact, he composed some of the best violin sonatas and concertos
            in history.
        </p>
        <h3 class="StyleMusicWriting" id="section-SMW">Style of Music Writing</h3>
        <p class="styleMusicWriteThing">Beethoven's style of music writing was quite unique. Unlike Mozart, where he would compose the piece before writing it down, Beethoven's 
            conception of pieces was basically just him mixing up musical ideas until they sounded good, and became a whole composition. He mostly wrote in traditional classical 
            genres, symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, etc. He also had some romantic features in his music, like extra dynamics and use of instruments for special colors and 
            effects.</p>
        <h3 class="WhyIChoseBeethoven" id="section-WICB">Why I chose Beethoven</h3>
        <p class="beethovenChoseWhy">The reason why I chose Beethoven is because the first person who comes up to my head whenever I hear the word &quot;Classical&quot;, I instantly
            think of Beethoven. The reason why Beethoven is the first person that comes to my head is because of his music. Just like I previously mentioned, Beethoven's music is unique 
            because he mixes the classical and romantic periods really well. He was the one who brought the Classical form to it's highest expressive level because of this. I always have
            chills when listening to his symphonies, sonatas, and concertos. I admire how he managed to handle deafness and still countinued to composing through it. So that's 
            why I decided to pick one of the most popular composers of the &quot;Classical Era&quot;, Ludwig Van Beethoven.</p>
        <h3 class="ContributionsInfluence" id="section-CI">The contributions and influence in music and the legacy Beethoven left behind</h3>
        <p class="legacyLeftBehind">The contributions and influence Beethoven left was a gigantic part of music. He broke many different patterns of Classical music and made 
            a wider scope of sonatas, concertos, quartet and especially the symphony. A big figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras and he remains one of 
            the most famous and influential of all composers. The legacy he left behind is huge, he made personal expression have a bigger role in music, and took a whole new approach
            in composing music.
